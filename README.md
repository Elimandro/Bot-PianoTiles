This is an auto-clicker bot based on Python that uses color recognition at specific pixel positions. In this case, it's designed for a piano game (https://www.agame.com/game/magic-piano-tiles). It's a simple but effective format to begin developing my Python skills as a student of the Information Systems Engineering program. The libraries used are:

> pywin32
> pywin32con
> keyboard
> pyautogui
> opencv-python
> pillow
> time
> random
