# Bot-PianoTiles
This is a Python-based auto-clicker bot using color recognition at pixel positions, designed for the Magic Piano Tiles game. It's a simple yet effective way to enhance my Python skills as a student in Information Systems Engineering. The libraries used include pywin32, pyautogui, opencv-python, pillow, time, and random.
